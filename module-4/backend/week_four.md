## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

* What's the purpose of a project management tool?

To track user stories, bugs, and other tasks. Then assign these tasks to different members of the team and to sprints.

* What are the stages of a card when using Pivotal Tracker?

Not started, started, finished, delivered, accepted, rejected

* What are the four types of cards available in Pivotal Tracker?

Feature, bug, chore, release

* What's your favorite project management tool?

I've worked with Waffle, Trello, PivotalTracker, and Jira. So far, I like PT the best, but I found the sprint management more intuitive in Jira.

* Why do we create staging environments?

So we can test our application before delivery to the client, especially to test any issues with deployment.

* What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?

Try to say what you need to say in as few words as possible (less is more!). Illustrate your explanations with lots of examples. Have a FAQ section so you can highlight important issues with installation, dependencies, etc.

* What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?

Make sure the color scheme is colorblind friendly.

* What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?

I'm not sure. I missed that lesson.

* Why is continuous integration helpful/important?

I'm not sure. I missed that lesson.

* What are some continuous integration tools?

I've heard of Travis CI.

#### Review  

* What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?

Frequent commits, commit headlines less than 80 characters. When creating a PR include full summary of what the PR is doing, including notes for dependencies, screenshots, and supplemental material if necessary. Facilitate discussion on the PR with comments.

* What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?

I'm not really sure? I guess one of them is to create objects and attach methods to those objects rather than passing objects into methods?

* What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?

A module is a collection of methods, but it isn't an object. A class is ultimately a blueprint for an object. A module can be added to a class that gives it expanded functionality. It's like if you have a class called 'LegsRobot' that comes with some standard methods like walking or running. Then you load a module into it called 'SickDanceMoves' and now it can break dance. You could also load that same module into an 'ArmsRobot' class and now it can do gymnast moves.
